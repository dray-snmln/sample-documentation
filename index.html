            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
            <p>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.</p>
            <p>The standard for JavaScript is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth major version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft version, which is currently ECMAScript 2020.</p>

            <p>In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", before moving on to taking you through your first practical experience of writing JavaScript. After that, we discuss some key building blocks in detail, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</li>
                <li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a simple text label as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:</p>
            <code>Player 1: Chris</code>
            <p>Player 1: Chris</p>
            <p>Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:</p>
<code><pre>p {
    font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;
    letter-spacing: 1px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    text-align: center;
    border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
    background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);
    color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
    box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 3px 10px;
    display: inline-block;
    cursor: pointer;
}</pre></code>
              <p style="font-family: 'helvetica neue', helvetica, sans-serif;
                letter-spacing: 1px;
                text-transform: uppercase;
                text-align: center;
                border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
                background: rgba(0,0,200,0.3);
                color: rgba(0,0,200,0.6);
                box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,200,0.4);
                border-radius: 10px;
                padding: 3px 10px;
                display: inline-block;
                cursor: pointer;">Player 1: Chris</p>

                <header>Building Blocks</header>
                <p>In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.</p>
                <p>Before starting this module, you should have some familiarity with the basics of HTML and CSS, and you should have also worked through our previous module, JavaScript first steps.</p>
                <p>In any programming language, code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is night. In this article we'll explore how conditional structures work in JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Sometimes you need a task done more than once in a row. For example, looking through a list of names. In programming, loops perform this job very well. Here we will look at loop structures in JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Another essential concept in coding is functions. Functions allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define functions, scope, and parameters.</p>
                <p>Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired. For example if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to respond to that action by displaying an information box. In this final article we will discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at how they work in browsers.</p>
            </section>
           <section id="if_else" class="main-section">
                <header>if...else statements</header>
                <code><pre>
if (condition) {
    code to run if condition is true
    } else {
    run some other code instead
    }           </pre></code>
                <ol>
                    <li>The keyword <i>if</i> followed by some parentheses.</li>
                    <li>A condition to test, placed inside the parentheses (typically "is this value bigger than this other value?", or "does this value exist?"). The condition makes use of the comparison operators we discussed in the last module and returns <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>.</li>
                    <li>A set of curly braces, inside which we have some code — this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition returns <i>true</i>.</li>
                    <li>he keyword <i>else</i>.</li>
                    <li>Another set of curly braces, inside which we have some more code — this can be any code we like, and it only runs if the condition is not <i>true</i> — or in other words, the condition is <i>false</i>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>However, you need to be careful here — in this case, the second block of code is not controlled by the conditional statement, so it always runs, regardless of whether the condition returns true or false. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it might not be what you want — often you want to run one block of code or the other, not both.</p>
                <p>As a final point, you may sometimes see if...else statements written without the curly braces, in the following shorthand style:</p>
                <p>Human beings (and other animals) make decisions all the time that affect their lives, from small ("should I eat one cookie or two?") to large ("should I stay in my home country and work on my father's farm, or should I move to America and study astrophysics?")</p>
                <p>Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made (for example, "one cookie or two"), to the resulting outcome of those choices (perhaps the outcome of "ate one cookie" might be "still felt hungry", and the outcome of "ate two cookies" might be "felt full, but mom scolded me for eating all the cookies".)</p>
                <p>if...else statements do the job of enabling conditional code well, but they are not without their downsides. They are mainly good for cases where you've got a couple of choices, and each one requires a reasonable amount of code to be run, and/or the conditions are complex (for example, multiple logical operators). For cases where you just want to set a variable to a certain choice of value or print out a particular statement depending on a condition, the syntax can be a bit cumbersome, especially if you've got a large number of choices.</p>

            <p>Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters.</p>
            <p>In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been using functions all the way through the course so far; we've just not been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to start talking about functions explicitly, and really exploring their syntax.</p>
            <p>Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — () — and you're not using a common built-in language structure like a for loop, while or do...while loop, or if...else statement, you are making use of a function.</p>
            <p>We've made use of functions built in to the browser a lot in this course. Every time we manipulated a text string, for example:</p>
            <code><pre>let myText = 'I am a string';
let newString = myText.replace('string', 'sausage');
console.log(newString);
// the replace() string function takes a source string,
// and a target string and replaces the source string,
// with the target string, and returns the newly formed string</pre></code>
            <p>The JavaScript language has many built-in functions to allow you to do useful things without having to write all that code yourself. In fact, some of the code you are calling when you invoke (a fancy word for run, or execute) a built in browser function couldn't be written in JavaScript — many of these functions are calling parts of the background browser code, which is written largely in low-level system languages like C++, not web languages like JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Bear in mind that some built-in browser functions are not part of the core JavaScript language — some are defined as part of browser APIs, which build on top of the default language to provide even more functionality (refer to this early section of our course for more descriptions). We'll look at using browser APIs in more detail in a later module.</p>

        <section id="events" class="main-section">
            <header>Events</header>
            <p>Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired. For example, if the user selects a button on a webpage, you might want to respond to that action by displaying an information box. In this article, we discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at how they work in browsers. This won't be an exhaustive study; just what you need to know at this stage.</p>
            <p>In the case of the Web, events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it — this might be a single element, set of elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are many different types of events that can occur. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The user selects a certain element or hovers the cursor over a certain element.</li>
                <li>The user chooses a key on the keyboard.</li>
                <li>The user resizes or closes the browser window.</li>
                <li>A web page finishes loading.</li>
                <li>A form is submitted.</li>
                <li>A video is played, paused, or finishes.</li>
                <li>An error occurs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each available event has an event handler, which is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires. When such a block of code is defined to run in response to an event, we say we are registering an event handler. Note: Event handlers are sometimes called event listeners — they are pretty much interchangeable for our purposes, although strictly speaking, they work together. The listener listens out for the event happening, and the handler is the code that is run in response to it happening.</p>
            <p>Let's look at a simple example of what we mean here. You've already seen events and event handlers used in many of the examples, but let's recap just to cement our knowledge. In the following example, we have a single button, which when pressed, makes the background change to a random color:</p>
                <code><pre>const btn = document.querySelector('button');
function random(number) {
return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number+1));
}

btn.onclick = function() {
const rndCol = 'rgb(' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ',' + random(255) + ')';
document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
}</pre></code>
            <p>In this code, we store a reference to the button inside a constant called btn, using the Document.querySelector() function. We also define a function that returns a random number. The third part of the code is the event handler. The btn constant points to a button element, and this type of object has a number of events that can fire on it, and therefore, event handlers available. We are listening for the click event firing, by setting the onclick event handler property to equal an anonymous function containing code that generates a random RGB color and sets the body background-color equal to it.</p>
            <p>Another thing worth mentioning at this point is that events are not unique to JavaScript — most programming languages have some kind of event model, and the way the model works often differs from JavaScript's way. In fact, the event model in JavaScript for web pages differs from the event model for JavaScript as it is used in other environments.</p>
